# Test protocol compatibility between latest and old databend-meta

## Prerequisites

- Current version of databend-meta must reside in `./bins`:
    - `./bins/current/databend-meta`

    Since building a binary takes several minutes,
    this step is usually done by the calling process, e.g., the CI script.
