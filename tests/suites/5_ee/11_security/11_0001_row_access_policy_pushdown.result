#### Test: SecureFilter should not block filter/limit pushdown
#### setup: enable row access policy and create test table
>>>> SET GLOBAL enable_experimental_row_access_policy = 1
>>>> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rap_pushdown_test
>>>> DROP ROW ACCESS POLICY IF EXISTS rap_pushdown_policy
>>>> CREATE TABLE rap_pushdown_test(id INT, name STRING, region STRING)
>>>> INSERT INTO rap_pushdown_test VALUES (1, 'alice', 'APAC'), (2, 'bob', 'EMEA'), (3, 'carol', 'APAC')
3
#### create row access policy
>>>> CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY rap_pushdown_policy AS (region STRING) RETURNS boolean -> region = 'APAC'
>>>> ALTER TABLE rap_pushdown_test ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY rap_pushdown_policy ON (region)
#### test 1: filter pushdown through SecureFilter
#### EXPLAIN should show filters pushed down to TableScan (not empty)
        ├── push downs: [filters: [is_true(rap_pushdown_test.id (#0) > 0)], limit: NONE]
#### test 2: limit pushdown through SecureFilter (with WHERE clause)
#### Note: limit is NOT pushed down because sort rule runs before filter pushdown, so push_down_predicates is still empty
#### test 3: verify SecureFilter is preserved in the plan
1
#### test 4: limit should NOT be pushed down when only SecureFilter exists (no user WHERE)
#### This is a safety check - limit without filter predicates could cause incorrect results
        ├── push downs: [filters: [], limit: NONE]
#### test 5: sort (ORDER BY + LIMIT) should NOT push limit when only SecureFilter exists
#### This is a safety check - TopK pruning could cause incorrect results
                ├── push downs: [filters: [], limit: NONE]
#### test 6: sort + filter pushdown through SecureFilter
#### Note: limit is NOT pushed down because sort rule runs before filter pushdown
#### cleanup
