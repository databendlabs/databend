# name: test/sql/join/asof/test_asof_join_missing.test_slow
# description: Test As-Of join with missing matches
# group: [asof]


# These test stress several aspects of the matching:
# * Probe inequality less than the minimum (no match)
# * Probe equality missing (no match)
# * More than 64 valid probe entries (mask => SV construction)
# * First radix bin empty.
# * First payload bin empty 
# * Multiple scanned payload blocks

# Check results against IEJoin

# 10 dates, 5 keys
