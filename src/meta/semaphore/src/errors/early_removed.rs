/// This error indicates that a semaphore permit entry was deleted from the queue
/// while still waiting to be acquired. Common scenarios include:
///
/// - **TTL Expiration**: The permit's time-to-live expired while waiting
/// - **Manual Removal**: External processes or administrators removed the permit
/// - **Service Restart**: Meta-service restart with non-persistent permit entries
/// - **Queue Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of stale or orphaned entries
///
/// This is typically a transient condition that can be resolved by retrying
/// the acquisition with a fresh permit entry.
