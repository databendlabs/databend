//! Sealed traits and implementations to handle all _physical types_ used in this crate.
//!
//! Most physical types used in this crate are native Rust types, such as `i32`.
//! The trait [`NativeType`] describes the interfaces required by this crate to be conformant
//! with Arrow.
//!
//! Every implementation of [`NativeType`] has an associated variant in [`PrimitiveType`],
//! available via [`NativeType::PRIMITIVE`].
//! Combined, these allow structs generic over [`NativeType`] to be trait objects downcastable
//! to concrete implementations based on the matched [`NativeType::PRIMITIVE`] variant.
//!
//! Another important trait in this module is [`Offset`], the subset of [`NativeType`] that can
//! be used in Arrow offsets (`i32` and `i64`).
//!
//! Another important trait in this module is [`BitChunk`], describing types that can be used to
//! represent chunks of bits (e.g. 8 bits via `u8`, 16 via `u16`), and [`BitChunkIter`],
//! that can be used to iterate over bitmaps in [`BitChunk`]s according to
//! Arrow's definition of bitmaps.
//!
//! Finally, this module contains traits used to compile code based on [`NativeType`] optimized
//! for SIMD, at [`mod@simd`].
