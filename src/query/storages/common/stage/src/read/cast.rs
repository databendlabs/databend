/// limits automatic type casting when loading data with a specified schema, applicable to formats like Parquet, ORC, Iceberg, and Delta.
///
/// # Operation:
///
/// - The check occurs after the schema is read but before the data is processed.
/// - This approach is designed to:
///   - Enhance User Experience: By identifying errors early, especially beneficial when loading large datasets.
///   - Optimize Schema Matching: Assist users in achieving a correct schema more swiftly and avoiding potential mistakes.
///
/// # Notes:
///
/// - A successful return does not guarantee load success; some casts depend on the actual data values.
/// - Users have the option to use casting functions in transformations to override these rules.
/// - This is distinct from the casting behavior in SQL statements like INSERT INTO <table> VALUES <values>, without an explicit FROM_TYPE.
/// - It differs from common_expression::can_auto_cast_to, which pertains to casting towards a supertype. This is further elaborated below.
///
/// # Rule Selection Criteria:
///
/// ## Forbidding Casts:
///
///  - Ambiguity: Prevents data from being loaded without errors but deviates from user expectations, which can be detrimental. Users might realize they have loaded incorrect data too late, potentially after the original data has been deleted.
///  - Uselessness: Prohibits casts that result in information loss and offer no benefit, often indicative of user error. Restricting such casts may guide users towards better practices.
///
/// ## Permitting Casts:
///
///  - Specificity: Encourages loading into a more specific type, as it typically requires less storage or provides more information. which is valuable in ETL processes.
///     -  Often accompanied by safety measures: Requires a specific format, and any mismatch will readily trigger an error, minimizing significant issues in production.
///  - Convenience: For instance, Python users might use the Python int type for convenience, which corresponds to int64 in Parquet. Thus, casting from int64 to smaller integers is allowed.
///  - Compatibility: Initially, the rules are based on the intersection of arrow_cast::can_cast_to() and all pairs that are operational from running run_cast, both of which are quite permissive.
///     - but maybe not a big issue, since user can start with infer_schema.
